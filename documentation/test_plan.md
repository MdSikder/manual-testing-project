# **Test Plan for Registration Page**

## **1. Introduction**  
This document outlines the Test Plan for the **Registration Page** of the application. The purpose of this test is to verify the correctness, completeness, and robustness of the registration process by executing both positive and negative scenarios. This will ensure the page meets functional, security, and usability requirements.  

## **2. Objective**  
- Ensure all input fields meet validation rules (e.g., password strength, email format).  
- Verify the system handles invalid input gracefully by displaying appropriate error messages.  
- Ensure the overall registration process operates smoothly, storing user data as expected.  

## **3. Scope of Testing**  
The scope includes testing all input fields, error messages, form submission, and backend validations. It also covers usability, security aspects (like blocking cross-site scripting), and boundary testing for various fields.

### **In-Scope:**  
- Functional Testing  
- Usability Testing  
- Validation Testing  
- Cross-Browser Testing  
- Security Testing (XSS Validation)  

### **Out-of-Scope:**  
- Backend API testing (to be covered separately).  
- Performance testing under load (handled during performance tests).

## **4. Test Items**  
The registration page contains the following fields to be tested:  
- **Username**: Min 5 characters, Max 15 characters, no special symbols.  
- **Password**: Must contain uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character, and be at least 8 characters long.  
- **Email**: Valid email format required.  
- **Phone Number**: Numeric-only, 10-15 digits.  
- **Gender**: Must select one option.  
- **Date of Birth**: Should be in the past.  
- **Country**: Selectable from a dropdown.  
- **Terms and Conditions Checkbox**: Mandatory acceptance.

## **5. Test Approach**  
- **Manual Testing**: Execute each test case manually to validate the functionality.  
- **Positive Testing**: Provide valid inputs to ensure the system works as expected.  
- **Negative Testing**: Enter invalid data to verify the error messages and field validations.  
- **Boundary Value Testing**: Test field limits (e.g., min/max length of the username).  
- **Usability Testing**: Validate the ease of use, proper field alignment, and button functionality.
